### Objective

The goal of this take-home test is to assess your test planning skills, ability to articulate your thought process, and capability to write automated tests. 
All in all, you will be interacting with "demo repo", designing a test plan, and presenting your approach via live follow up call (30 minutes).
The actual "take home assignment" should not take longer than 1 hour (I value your time and would not ask more than this).

If there are any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly:

### Steps to Complete the Challenge

#### 1. Clone the Repository (<5 minutes)
- https://github.com/on-demand-trading/qa-eng-take-home.git
```bash
gh repo clone on-demand-trading/qa-eng-take-home
```
#### 2. Explore the Platform (10 minutes)
- Spend some time navigating through the features and functionalities available (as well as any documentation you find in the repo).  
- Identify key areas that may require testing.  
#### 3. Develop a Test Plan (20 minutes)
Based on your exploration, create a structured test plan. Your test plan should include:
- Test Objectives: What are you trying to validate?    
- Scope of Testing: Define what areas of the platform you will be testing.      
- Test Scenarios: List specific scenarios you will cover.  
- Test Cases: Provide detailed test steps, expected results, and actual results.  
- Tools & Methodology: Mention any tools or methodologies you would use. 
- Bug Reporting Strategy: Outline how you would report defects.  
#### 4. Set Up an Automated Test Framework (20 minutes)
- Using a language and framework of your choice (e.g., Python + Selenium, JavaScript + Cypress, Python + Pytest, etc.), set up a basic automated test framework.  
- Implement 1â€“2 automated tests based on scenarios from your test plan (and depending on time)
	- NOTE: it is not expected to implement all tests from your test plan, just one that you would like to talk about
- Be sure to include:
	- A README with instructions on how to set up and run your tests.  
	- Comments or documentation in the code to explain your approach.  
#### 5. Submit Your Work
- Share your test plan document (Google Docs, Notion, or any preferred format).  
- Include a link to your code repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
	- Please do not commit to test repo or open PRs (as others will be taking the same test)
- Email your submission to: casey.wilson@investifi.co

### Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on:
- Clarity & Structure: How well-defined and structured your test plan is.  
- Comprehensiveness: Coverage of key test scenarios.  
- Critical Thinking: Ability to identify edge cases and potential issues.  
- Communication: How effectively you articulate your approach in the follow up call.  
- Technical Skill: Ability to implement and run automated tests in a clean and reproducible way.
